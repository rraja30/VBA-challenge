# VBA-challenge

Given a data set I created a VBA script that loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs the following information: the ticker symbol, yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year, the percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year, and the total stock volume of the stock. It was also essential to use conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red in the yearly change.
